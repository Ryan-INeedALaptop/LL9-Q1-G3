    <h2>Our Chosen Content Type</h2>
    <p>
      The survey played a big role in helping us choose a topic, especially since we were struggling on what would be the most attractive type of content for students our age. After brainstorming with my groupmates, we decided that our YouTube channel would center around short animated documentaries on historical events. To describe our idea, let’s take the french revolution as the historical event to be discussed for example. Our idea centers around short and animated re-enactments of historical events (which in this case would be the french revolution). So, taking into account our scenario, our video under those terms would feature animated characters drawn poorly (to add comedic effect) representing the monarchs, and tax payers. A playful and engaging narrator would accompany the video while narrating happenings and providing factual information.

    <h2>Our Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      Based on our survey, the results calculated that our target audience mostly consists of students ranging from ages 13 to 18 years old. Some of these students might also need an additional or alternative source of information regarding certain topics. Our idea would only act as some sort of propaganda to lure students into watching our documentary—they typically don’t just settle for a boring, bland and unstimulating narrative. For a more clear and organized demographic of our target audience, see the table below.

          Most respondents were between the ages 14 years old (46.2%^) and 15 years old (23.1%), with smaller groups aged 13, 16, 18, 21, and 41+.

          Our target audience’s gender rates are quite neutral, with a large 3/4ths saying they're male or female with the remaining choosing not to say anything.

    <h2>Needs</h2>
    <p>
      After conducting basic research on documentaries in multiple sites, we’ve found the sufficient needs for it to be done. For our audience—since this is a documentary—it’s a must we ensure that the information we provide is factual and reliable. Furthermore, we should present sufficient context for our audience to comprehend and understand the topic at hand. An engaging narrator and a well-defined artistic concept are also essential for an eye-catching presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A content creator needs several important things to be successful. First, research is essential to ensure the information we share is accurate and reliable. We also need a clear objective so that our work stays focused and aligned with our goals. Having the right equipment makes it possible to produce high-quality content that stands out. Lastly, creativity ties everything together, allowing us to present our ideas in unique and engaging ways.
